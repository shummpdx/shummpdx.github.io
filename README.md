I used much of my inspiration from Man Parvesh's site. I found it really simplistic and elegant. I also really liked how Matt Farley presented his projects with the image inside of the container zooming in on a hover with a black background fading in and a short description of the project. 

I tried to use both flexbox and grid to adaptively displace my content. 

JavaScript is used to show the modals which contain a slideshow of images of my plants and score cards for the NCL Competition.

The form does not actually submit.
